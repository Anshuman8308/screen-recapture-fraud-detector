# Screen Recapture Fraud Detector

A lightweight computer vision system that detects whether an input image is:

- A genuine camera captured photo (`REAL`)
- A recaptured image photographed from another screen such as a phone, laptop, or monitor (`FAKE`)

This project was built as a fraud detection solution for identifying screen recapture attempts in mobile verification workflows.

---

## Problem Statement

In many mobile applications, users may attempt to bypass verification by photographing another screen displaying an image instead of capturing a real-world object.

The goal is to detect whether an image is:

- Directly captured from a camera
- Re-photographed from a digital display (screen recapture fraud)

The solution should remain lightweight, fast, and suitable for future mobile deployment.

## Approach

Instead of using a heavy deep learning model, this system uses handcrafted computer vision features designed specifically to capture screen recapture artifacts.

Extracted features include:

- FFT Frequency Analysis
- Patch-wise Frequency Analysis
- Local Binary Pattern (LBP) Texture Features
- HSV Color Distribution Statistics
- Brightness and Exposure Analysis
- Screen Glare Detection
- Edge Density Features
- Noise and Compression Artifact Analysis

These features are combined into a feature vector and passed to a lightweight ensemble classifier.

## Installation

Clone repository:

```bash
git clone <your_repo_link>
cd <repo_name>
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running Prediction (CLI)

Run prediction on a single image:

```bash
python predict.py path_to_image.jpg
```

Example:

```bash
python predict.py sample.jpg
```

Output:

```text
Prediction: FAKE
Confidence: 98.42%
```

## Running Web Interface

Start Gradio app locally:

```bash
python app.py
```

This launches a browser interface where images can be uploaded for real-time prediction.

## Possible Improvements

With a larger production-scale dataset, future improvements could include:

- More screen types (OLED, LCD, AMOLED)
- Printed photo fraud detection
- Adversarial fraud cases
- Mobile optimization using ONNX / TensorFlow Lite
- Threshold calibration for production fraud scoring
